# Projects

## 📊 Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms for Bank Marketing Prediction
This project was implemented during the Introduction to Machine Learning & Data Analytics (CMPE 390) course at AUBH, where MATLAB was used to compare different machine learning techniques to a provided dataset to compare their coefficients and performance measures, hence determining their suitability for predicting bank marketing.



## 🌡️ Creating a Temperature System using the Raspberry Pi Pico-Sensor Kit
The temperature system would let the user know if the room is cold, hot, or warm; if the room is hot, a sound will play from the buzzer. 
The temperature system would benefit the users in many ways, and the benefits below show why it is important to build a temperature system:
- Comfort – Allowing users to regulate the room temperature according to their preferences.
- Energy sufficiency – Helping users save energy and avoid unnecessary energy loss, leading to cost savings.
- Users’ health/well-being – Could maintain temperatures that could help prevent cold or heat-related issues such as hypothermia or heatstroke.



## 💻 AUBH Lost & Found System
Three students implemented this project for a Windows Programming (CMPE 361) course at the American University of Bahrain (AUBH) in December 2022.
JavaFX, Eclipse & SceneBuilder were used for the project's implementation.
The project consists of a JavaFX application that tracks lost and found items at AUBH, where the user can add, edit, delete, undo the deletion of the items, and export them into a CSV file.
